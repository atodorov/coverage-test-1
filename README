This is a simple test for coverage.py. The directory layout
matches my use-case in production and is probably important!

1) cd tests/

If --rcfile is not specified in run_test.sh the result is:


./run_test.sh 
Coverage.py, version 4.0.
Documentation at https://coverage.readthedocs.org
----------------------------------
Hello from /tmp/test1/myanaconda/mod1.py
Hello from /tmp/test1/mydracut/mod1.py
----------------------------------
Name                                Stmts   Miss  Cover
-------------------------------------------------------
/tmp/test1/myanaconda/__init__.py       0      0   100%
/tmp/test1/myanaconda/mod1.py           2      0   100%
/tmp/test1/mydracut/__init__.py         0      0   100%
/tmp/test1/mydracut/mod1.py             2      0   100%
test_everything.py                      4      0   100%
-------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                   8      0   100%



In the coverage report only __init__.py and mod1.py files are present which
is the correct behavior because mod2.py and anaconda are not imported.



2) When --rcfile is specified and .coveragerc looks like this:

[run]
source=../


the result is:

$ ./run_test.sh 
Coverage.py, version 4.0.
Documentation at https://coverage.readthedocs.org
----------------------------------
Hello from /tmp/test1/myanaconda/mod1.py
Hello from /tmp/test1/mydracut/mod1.py
----------------------------------
Name                                Stmts   Miss  Cover
-------------------------------------------------------
/tmp/test1/myanaconda/__init__.py       0      0   100%
/tmp/test1/myanaconda/mod1.py           2      0   100%
/tmp/test1/myanaconda/mod2.py           2      2     0%
/tmp/test1/mydracut/__init__.py         0      0   100%
/tmp/test1/mydracut/mod1.py             2      0   100%
/tmp/test1/mydracut/mod2.py             2      2     0%
test_everything.py                      4      0   100%
-------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                  12      4    67%


Notice how mod2.py files are reported in the output. However the top-most
file ./anaconda is not included. According to the documentation:

    Only importable files (ones at the root of the tree, or in directories with
    a __init__.py file) will be considered...


So ./anaconda is at the root of the .. tree but was not considered. BUG!



3) If you modify the .coveragerc file like this:

[run]
source=../anaconda,../


the result is the same as in 2). ./anaconda was not included in the
report although it was explicitly specified. BUG!
